# The Problem Scholarly Solves
Scholarly is designed specifically for students navigating complex academic systems, but it can also support colleges, institutions, and scholarship bodies.

Some of the use cases are:

- Helping students understand exam form instructions. Most exam forms are written in complex English, making it difficult for students—especially non-English-medium learners—to know what to fill. Scholarly explains every field clearly in the student’s preferred language, in real time.

- Providing guided workflows for academic processes. For example, if a student is confused about the re-evaluation process, Scholarly generates a complete step-by-step guide on what to do next.

- Clarifying scholarship eligibility. Scholarly reads uploaded scholarship PDFs using OCR and simplifies the entire document into bullet points.

- Integrating inside college portals to make notices, forms, and guidelines understandable. It detects key instructions and highlights important actions.

- Powering student service kiosks to offer multilingual academic assistance, especially for first-generation and vernacular-medium students.

# What Problem Does Scholarly Actually Solve?
Students struggle to understand academic rules, deadlines, forms, and procedures because everything is written in overly formal English. This causes confusion, errors, missed opportunities, and frequent visits to administrative offices.

Scholarly increases academic clarity by:
- Reading any academic document  
- Extracting important details  
- Simplifying complex language  
- Explaining content in the user’s preferred language  
- Providing step-by-step workflows for complicated processes  

We have also built a document-simplification-as-a-service interface where users can upload any academic PDF, notice, or form and instantly receive a simplified, multilingual version.

Scholarly acts as a middleman between academic documents and students, reducing confusion and enabling accurate, confident submissions.
